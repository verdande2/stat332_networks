I've given you a gml file for this homework. This one happens to be
college football teams.\
Now, I really know little to nothing about college football, but I'm
pretty sure there are "communities" of teams that should be able to be
identified. There are also teams that everyone wants to play in order to
increase their rankings (cores?) etc...

Using a collection of the methods from class, find the subgroups within
this network that might indicate clusters of teams. :)

1.) Plot things out.

2.) Use multiple methods and create matrices that represent how much
agreement or disagreement the methods have.

3.) Find the cores.

4.) Find the cliques

5.) Explain the results.
