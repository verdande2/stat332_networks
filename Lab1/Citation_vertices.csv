Poor preprocessing on the other hand can make classification almost impossible. In this paper we evaluate several feature extraction methods in a special type of outlier detection problem, machine fault detection. We will consider measurements on water pumps under both normal and abnormal conditions. We use a novel data description method, called the Support Vector Data Description, to get an indication of the complexity of the normal class in this data set and how well it is expected to be distinguishable from the abnormal data.",Pump {{Failure Detection Using Support Vector Data Descriptions}

The boundary of a dataset can be used to detect novel data or outliers. We will present the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) which is inspired by the Support Vector Classifier. It obtains a spherically shaped boundary around a dataset and analogous to the Support Vector Classifier it can be made flexible by using other kernel functions. The method is made robust against outliers in the training set and is capable of tightening the description by using negative examples.

4,4,2008,Wilson Wang,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,"A reliable monitoring system is critically needed in a wide range of industries to detect the occurrence of a fault to prevent machinery performance degradation, malfunction, and sudden failure. In this paper, a new intelligent system, extended neurofuzzy (ENF) scheme, is proposed for real-time machinery condition monitoring. The monitoring reliability is improved by integrating the predicted machinery condition to fault diagnosis. The ENF scheme can perform both classification and prediction operations. The ENF classifier integrates the merits of several signal processing techniques for a more positive assessment of the machinery condition. The ENF predictor forecasts the machinery condition propagation trends. An interscheme training technique is proposed to improve the ENF system's adaptive capability to accommodate different operation conditions. The viability of this new monitoring system has been verified by experimental tests. Test results have shown that the developed ENF system is a robust condition monitoring tool that has good adaptive capabilities to accommodate different machinery conditions.",An {{Intelligent System}} for {{Machinery Condition Monitoring}
5,5,2008,"Saxena, Abhinav",ICPHM Proceedings,"This paper describes how damage propagation can be modeled within the modules of aircraft gas turbine engines. To that end, response surfaces of all sensors are generated via a thermo-dynamical simulation model for the engine as a function of variations of flow and efficiency of the modules of interest. An exponential rate of change for flow and efficiency loss was imposed for each data set, starting at a randomly chosen initial deterioration set point. The rate of change of the flow and efficiency denotes an otherwise unspecified fault with increasingly worsening effect. The rates of change of the faults were constrained to an upper threshold but were otherwise chosen randomly. Damage propagation was allowed to continue until a failure criterion was reached. A health index was defined as the minimum of several superimposed operational margins at any given time instant and the failure criterion is reached when health index reaches zero. Output of the model was the time series (cycles) of sensed measurements typically available from aircraft gas turbine engines. The data generated were used as challenge data for the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) data competition atPHM'08.",Damage Propagation Modeling for Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Simulation

It is a proactive process that requires the development of a predictive model that can trigger the alarm for corresponding maintenance. Prognostic methodologies for CBM have only recently been introduced into the technical literature and become such a focus in the field of maintenance research and development. There are many research and development on a variety of technologies and algorithms that can be regarded as the steps toward prognostic maintenance. They are needed in order to support decision making and manage operational reliability. In this paper, recent literature that focuses on the machine prognostics has been reviewed. Generally, prognostic models can be classified into four categories: physical model, knowledge-based model, data-driven model, and combination model. Various techniques and algorithms have been developed depending on what models they usually adopt. Based on the review of some typical approaches and new introduced methods, advantages and disadvantages of these methodologies are discussed. From the literature review, some increasing trends appeared in the research field of machine prognostics are summarized.",Current Status of Machine Prognostics in Condition-Based Maintenance: A Review
10,10,2010,"Wang, Wenbin",PHM2010,"As an efficient means of detecting potential plant failure, condition monitoring is growing popular in industry with million's spent on condition monitoring hardware and software. The use of condition monitoring techniques will generally increase plant availability and reduce downtime costs, but in some cases it will also tend to over-maintaining the plant in question. There is obviously a need for appropriate decision support in plant maintenance planning utilising available condition monitoring information, but compared to the extensive literature on diagnosis, relatively little research has been done on the prognosis side of condition based maintenance. In plant prognosis, a key, but often uncertain quantity to be modelled is the residual life prediction based on available condition information to date. This paper shall focus upon such a residual life prediction of the monitored items in condition based maintenance and review the recent developments in modelling residual life prediction using stochastic filtering. We first demonstrate the role of residual life prediction in condition based maintenance decision making, which highlights the need for such a prediction. We then discuss in detail the basic filtering model we used for residual life prediction and the extensions we made. We finally present briefly the result of the comparative studies between the filtering based model and other models using empirical data. The results show that the filtering based approach is the best in terms of prediction accuracy and cost effectiveness.",A Stochastic Filtering Based Data Driven Approach for Residual Life Prediction and Condition Based Maintenance Decision Making Support

This class of prognostic algorithms is termed effects-based, or Type III, prognostics. A unitspecific prognostic model, called the General Path Model, involve identifying an appropriate degradation measure to characterize the system's progression to failure. A functional fit of this parameter is then extrapolated to a pre-defined failure threshold to estimate the remaining useful life of the system or component. This paper proposes a specific formulation of the General Path Model with dynamic Bayesian updating as one effects-based prognostic algorithm.

12,12,2016,"Pan, Donghui",Neurocomputing,"The use of degradation data to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) has gained great attention with the widespread use of prognostics and health management on safety critical systems. Accurate RUL estimation can prevent system failure and reduce the running risks since the efficient maintenance service could be scheduled in advance. In this paper, we present a degradation modeling and RUL estimation approach by using available degradation data for a deteriorating system. An inverse Gaussian process with the random effect is firstly used to characterize the degradation process of the system. Expectation maximization algorithm is then adopted to estimate the model parameters, and the random parameters in the degradation model are updated by Bayesian method, which makes the estimated RUL able to be real-time updated in terms of the fresh degradation data. Our proposed method can capture the latest condition of the system by means of updating degradation data continuously, and obtain the explicit expression of RUL distribution. Finally, a numerical example and a practical case study are provided to show that the presented approach can effectively model degradation process for the individual system and obtain better results for RUL estimation.",Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using an Inverse {{Gaussian}} Degradation Model

The purpose of the paper is to transform the monitoring vibration signals into features that can be used to track the health condition of bearings and to estimate their remaining useful life. PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of original vibration features by removing the redundant ones. SVDD is a pattern recognition method based on structural risk minimization principles. In this contribution, the SVDD is used to fit the trained data to a hypersphere such that its radius can be used as a health indicator. The proposed method is then applied on real bearing degradation performed on an accelerated life test.

14,14,2013,"Jablonski, A.",Measurement,"A suitable setting of threshold levels has been a dilemma for engineers in a number of science and industrial fields. It is a common problem in monitoring, where deviation from a correct state needs to be detected. As the number of monitored values in modern systems reaches thousands, threshold calculations became a significant yet frequently underestimated concern. Due to a prohibitive cost of manual threshold setting, many systems generate thousands of false alarms consequent upon running on default threshold levels. In the paper, the authors illustrate a methodology for automatic threshold calculations in a large monitoring system. The paper is mainly addressed to engineers and machine monitoring systems developers, therefore selected statistical topics were treated briefly with main focus on practical solutions. Two fundamental data types are considered; namely, vibration signal measures, which can be extended to any nonnegative data, and symmetrical process values. As it is shown, these data types have significantly different probability distributions. Since real data seldom fits the Gaussian model, an investigation of several distributions and their comparison is presented. The proposed approach is validated on four datasets including process values from a gas compressor and vibration signal measures from a wind turbine.",Modeling of Probability Distribution Functions for Automatic Threshold Calculation in Condition Monitoring Systems
15,15,2013,"Miao, Qiang",Microelectronics Reliability,"Accurate prediction of the remaining useful life of a faulty component is important to the prognosis and health management of a system. It gives operators information about when the component should be replaced. In recent years, a lot of research has been conducted on battery reliability and prognosis, especially the remaining useful life prediction of the lithium-ion batteries. Particle filter (PF) is an effective method for sequential signal processing. It has been used in many areas, including computer vision, target tracking, and robotics. However, the accuracy of the PF is not high. This paper introduces an improved PF algorithm-unscented particle filter (UPF) into the battery remaining useful life prediction. First, PF algorithm and UPF algorithm are described separately. Then, a degradation model is built based on the understanding of lithium-ion batteries. Finally, the prediction results can be obtained using the degradation model and the UPF algorithms. According to the analysis results, it can be seen that UPF can predict the actual RUL with an error less than 5\%.",Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-Ion Battery with Unscented Particle Filter Technique
16,16,2013,"Ullah, Shahid",BMC Medical Research Methodology,"Background: Functional data analysis (FDA) is increasingly being used to better analyze, model and predict time series data. Key aspects of FDA include the choice of smoothing technique, data reduction, adjustment for clustering, functional linear modeling and forecasting methods. Methods: A systematic review using 11 electronic databases was conducted to identify FDA application studies published in the peer-review literature during 1995\textendash 2010. Papers reporting methodological considerations only were excluded, as were non-English articles. Results: In total, 84 FDA application articles were identified; 75.0\% of the reviewed articles have been published since 2005. Application of FDA has appeared in a large number of publications across various fields of sciences; the majority is related to biomedicine applications (21.4\%). Overall, 72 studies (85.7\%) provided information about the type of smoothing techniques used, with B-spline smoothing (29.8\%) being the most popular. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for extracting information from functional data was reported in 51 (60.7\%) studies. One-quarter (25.0\%) of the published studies used functional linear models to describe relationships between explanatory and outcome variables and only 8.3\% used FDA for forecasting time series data. Conclusions: Despite its clear benefits for analyzing time series data, full appreciation of the key features and value of FDA have been limited to date, though the applications show its relevance to many public health and biomedical problems. Wider application of FDA to all studies involving correlated measurements should allow better modeling of, and predictions from, such data in the future especially as FDA makes no a priori age and time effects assumptions.",Applications of Functional Data Analysis: {{A}} Systematic Review

Any types of prognostics methods can be used, including data-driven methods, model-based methods and integrated methods, as long as the prediction method can produce the predicted failure time distribution at any given inspection points. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to accurately and efficiently evaluate the cost of the CBM policy. The proposed approach is demonstrated using vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field as well as simulated degradation data.

18,18,2014,"Ramasso, Emmanuel",HAL,"Benchmarking of prognostic algorithms has been challenging due to limited availability of common datasets suitable for prognostics. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, several benchmarking datasets have been collected by NASA's prognostic center of excellence and made available to the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) community to allow evaluation and comparison of prognostics algorithms. Among those datasets are five C-MAPSS datasets that have been extremely popular due to their unique characteristics making them suitable for prognostics. The C-MAPSS datasets pose several challenges that have been tackled by different methods in the PHM literature. In particular, management of high variability due to sensor noise, effects of operating conditions, and presence of multiple simultaneous fault modes are some factors that have great impact on the generalization capabilities of prognostics algorithms. More than 70 publications have used the C-MAPSS datasets for developing data-driven prognostic algorithms. The C-MAPSS datasets are also shown to be well-suited for development of new machine learning and pattern recognition tools for several key preprocessing steps such as feature extraction and selection, failure mode assessment, operating conditions assessment, health status estimation, uncertainty management, and prognostics performance evaluation. This paper summarizes a comprehensive literature review of publications using C-MAPSS datasets and provides guidelines and references to further usage of these datasets in a manner that allows clear and consistent comparison between different approaches.",Review and {{Analysis}} of {{Algorithmic Approaches Developed}} for {{Prognostics}} on {{CMAPSS Dataset}

Condition monitoring systems (CMS) play an important role in the predictive maintenance cycle. As condition monitoring systems are being adopted by more and more OEM and O\&M service providers from the wind energy industry, it is crucial to effectively interpret the data generated by the CMS and initiate proactive processes to efficiently reduce the risk of potential component or system failure which often leads to down tower repair or gearbox replacement. The majority of CMS are designed and constructed based on vibration analysis which has been refined over the years by researchers and scientists.

A machinery prognostic program generally consists of four technical processes, i.e., data acquisition, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, and RUL prediction. Over recent years, a significant amount of research work has been undertaken in each of the four processes. And much literature has made an excellent overview on the last process, i.e., RUL prediction. However, there has not been a systematic review that covers the four technical processes comprehensively.

31,31,2019,"Li, Jialin",IEEE Access,"Accurate and timely prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of a machine enables the machine to have an appropriate operation and maintenance decision. Data-driven RUL prediction methods are more attractive to researchers because they can be deployed quicker and cheaper compared to other approaches. The existing deep neural network (DNN) models proposed for the applications of RUL prediction are mostly single-path and top-down propagation. In order to improve the prognostic accuracy of the network, this paper proposes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) network that combines long short term memory (LSTM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the RUL. Different from the existing prediction models combined with CNN and LSTM, the method proposed in this paper combines CNN and LSTM organically instead of just using CNN for feature extraction. Moreover, when a single timestamp is used as an input, padding the signals in the same training batch would affect the prediction ability of the developed model. To overcome this drawback, the proposed method generates a short-term sequence by sliding the time window (TW) with one step size. In addition, based on the degradation mechanism, the piece-wise RUL function is used instead of the traditional linear function. In the experimental test, the turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset provided by NASA is used to validate the proposed RUL prediction model.

35,35,2019,"Chen, Yunhong",Wireless Personal Communications,"Limited resources and harsh deployment environments may cause raw observations collected by sensor nodes to have poor data quality and reliability, which will influence the accuracy of the analysis and decision making in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Therefore, anomaly detection must be implemented on the data collected by nodes. Support vector data description based on spatiotemporal and attribute correlations (STASVDD) can efficiently detect outliers. A novel optimization method based on STASVDD (N-STASVDD) is put forward in this paper. The proposed method considers that outliers can independently occur in each attribute when the collected data vectors are independent and identically distributed in WSNs. The proposed method applies the concept of core-sets to reduce the computational complexity of the quadratic programming problem in STASVDD, consequently reducing the energy consumption of resources-constrained WSNs. In addition, comparing the distributed and centralized detection approach of this method, the results show that the distributed approach has better performance because it relieves the communication burden. Extensive experiments were performed on both synthetic and real WSNs datasets. Results revealed that N-STASVDD achieves low time complexity and high detection accuracy.",A {{Lightweight Anomaly Detection Method Based}} on {{SVDD}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}

37,37,2019,"Wang, Qiyao",IEEE,"Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an equipment or one of its components is defined as the time left until the equipment or component reaches its end of useful life. Accurate RUL estimation is exceptionally beneficial to Predictive Maintenance, and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Data driven approaches which leverage the power of algorithms for RUL estimation using sensor and operational time series data are gaining popularity. Existing algorithms, such as linear regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), have their own limitations for the RUL estimation task. In this work, we propose a novel Functional Data Analysis (FDA) method called functional Multilayer Perceptron (functional MLP) for RUL estimation. Functional MLP treats time series data from multiple equipment as a sample of random continuous processes over time. FDA explicitly incorporates both the correlations within the same equipment and the random variations across different equipment's sensor time series into the model. FDA also has the benefit of allowing the relationship between RUL and sensor variables to vary over time. We implement functional MLP on the benchmark NASA C-MAPSS data and evaluate the performance using two popularly-used metrics. Results show the superiority of our algorithm over all the other state-of-the-art methods.",Remaining {{Useful Life Estimation Using Functional Data Analysis}
38,38,2020,"Hong, Chang Woo",Sensors,"This study prognoses the remaining useful life of a turbofan engine using a deep learning model, which is essential for the health management of an engine. The proposed deep learning model affords a significantly improved accuracy by organizing networks with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, and bidirectional long short-term memory. In particular, this paper investigates two practical and crucial issues in applying the deep learning model for system prognosis. The first is the requirement of numerous sensors for different components, i.e., the curse of dimensionality. Second, the deep neural network cannot identify the problematic component of the turbofan engine due to its ``black box'' property. This study thus employs dimensionality reduction and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) techniques. Dimensionality reduction in the model reduces the complexity and prevents overfitting, while maintaining high accuracy. SHAP analyzes and visualizes the black box to identify the sensors. The experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model with dimensionality reduction and show that SHAP enhances the explainability in a conventional deep learning model for system prognosis.",Remaining {{Useful Life Prognosis}} for {{Turbofan Engine Using Explainable Deep Neural Networks}} with {{Dimensionality Reduction}

Generally, the effective prediction of RUL is achieved through a large amount of monitoring data, while how to extract degradation characteristics from the contaminated data to monitor the performance degradation trend of the system, and then estimate the RUL is a challenge. Therefore, a RUL prediction method based on support vector data description (SVDD) and particle filter (PF) is presented in this work. Firstly, SVDD is employed to extract a health indicator from a large amount of historical data that can reflect the degradation trend of system. Then, a degradation model is constructed to describe the degradation trend of health indicator and a failure threshold is determined accordingly. After that, the RUL is estimated based on the PF algorithm and the automatically determined failure threshold. Finally, the validity and superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by using an aircraft engine degradation dataset.",Degradation {{Trend Monitoring}} and {{Remaining Useful Life Prediction}} of {{Aircraft Engines}
40,40,2020,"K{\""o}nig, Caroline",Sensors,"Condition monitoring (CM) is a useful application in industry 4.0, where the machine's health is controlled by computational intelligence methods. Data-driven models, especially from the field of deep learning, are efficient solutions for the analysis of time series sensor data due to their ability to recognize patterns in high dimensional data and to track the temporal evolution of the signal. Despite the excellent performance of deep learning models in many applications, additional requirements regarding the interpretability of machine learning models are getting relevant. In this work, we present a study on the sensitivity of sensors in a deep learning based CM system providing high-level information about the relevance of the sensors. Several convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been constructed from a multisensory dataset for the prediction of different degradation states in a hydraulic system. An attribution analysis of the input features provided insights about the contribution of each sensor in the prediction of the classifier. Relevant sensors were identified, and CNN models built on the selected sensors resulted equal in prediction quality to the original models. The information about the relevance of sensors is useful for the system's design to decide timely on the required sensors.",Sensitivity {{Analysis}} of {{Sensors}} in a {{Hydraulic Condition Monitoring System Using CNN Models}
41,41,2020,"Kunto{\u g}lu, Mustafa",Sensors,"The complex structure of turning aggravates obtaining the desired results in terms of tool wear and surface roughness. The existence of high temperature and pressure make difficult to reach and observe the cutting area. In-direct tool condition, monitoring systems provide tracking the condition of cutting tool via several released or converted energy types, namely, heat, acoustic emission, vibration, cutting forces and motor current. Tool wear inevitably progresses during metal cutting and has a relationship with these energy types. Indirect tool condition monitoring systems use sensors situated around the cutting area to state the wear condition of the cutting tool without intervention to cutting zone. In this study, sensors mostly used in indirect tool condition monitoring systems and their correlations between tool wear are reviewed to summarize the literature survey in this field for the last two decades. The reviews about tool condition monitoring systems in turning are very limited, and relationship between measured variables such as tool wear and vibration require a detailed analysis. In this work, the main aim is to discuss the effect of sensorial data on tool wear by considering previous published papers.

42,42,2020,"Mahmoodzadeh, Zahra",Sensors,"Gas pipeline systems are one of the largest energy infrastructures in the world and are known to be very efficient and reliable. However, this does not mean they are prone to no risk. Corrosion is a significant problem in gas pipelines that imposes large risks such as ruptures and leakage to the environment and the pipeline system. Therefore, various maintenance actions are performed routinely to ensure the integrity of the pipelines. The costs of the corrosion-related maintenance actions are a significant portion of the pipeline's operation and maintenance costs, and minimizing this large cost is a highly compelling subject that has been addressed by many studies. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to the corrosion-related maintenance management of dry gas pipelines. We first address the rising need for a simulated testbed by proposing a test bench that models corrosion degradation while interacting with the maintenance decision-maker within the RL environment. Second, we propose a condition-based maintenance management approach that leverages a data-driven RL decision-making methodology. An RL maintenance scheduler is applied to the proposed test bench, and the results show that applying the proposed condition-based maintenance management technique can reduce up to 58\% of the maintenance costs compared to a periodic maintenance policy while securing pipeline reliability.",Condition-{{Based Maintenance}} with {{Reinforcement Learning}} for {{Dry Gas Pipeline Subject}} to {{Internal Corrosion}

44,44,2021,"Banerjee, Ahin","ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part A: Civil Engineering",Highly dynamic loading conditions on clutch motors used in four-wheeled passenger vehicles cause them to fail quite often. The current diagnostic tools have proven to be inefficient to detect the onset of system degradation. This paper presents a degradation model to exhibit the state of health of the clutch. A novel condition indicator (CI) and a threshold for conditionally independent noisy signal from the motor subjected to cumulative degradation have been established. A dominating feature characterizing the motor health was discerned to be spectral entropy kurtosis which was identified while analyzing the time-series signal composed of agglomeration of different frequencies that produce higher octaves. Tests for monotonocity and trendability metrics affirmed that spectral entropy kurtosis is a distinguishing CI. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed the fusion of features for the selection of the best-performing CI. The proposed CI was used in an exponential degradation model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the motor with improved accuracy.

Its impact is profound, and several fields have been fundamentally altered by it, autonomy and computer vision for example; reliability engineering and safety will undoubtedly follow suit. There is already a large but fragmented literature on ML for reliability and safety applications, and it can be overwhelming to navigate and integrate into a coherent whole. In this work, we facilitate this task by providing a synthesis of, and a roadmap to this everexpanding analytical landscape and highlighting its major landmarks and pathways. We first provide an over\- view of the different ML categories and sub-categories or tasks, and we note several of the corresponding models and algorithms. We then look back and review the use of ML in reliability and safety applications. We examine several publications in each category/sub-category, and we include a short discussion on the use of Deep Learning to highlight its growing popularity and distinctive advantages. Finally, we look ahead and outline several promising future opportunities for leveraging ML in service of advancing reliability and safety consid\- erations. Overall, we argue that ML is capable of providing novel insights and opportunities to solve important challenges in reliability and safety applications.
