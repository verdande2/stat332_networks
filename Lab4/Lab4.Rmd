## 1.) Setup

Welcome to Lab 4. This week we are going to be focused on macro-scale measures on networks. While it takes a long time to learn these measures, the vast majority are built directly into `igraph` and only need the correct use of the function to calculate.

For our dataset this week, we're going to use the Game of Thrones network from the popular book (I'll admit, I tried, but only got through the first couple of chapters before I was too disturbed to read it, but it is popular...).

## 2.) Lab Walkthrough

### 2.a) Getting started.

Using `ctrl-alt-i` you can create a section where you are going to embed R code. We're going to start by loading in the `igraph` library.

```{r}
library(igraph) 
```

```{r}
g <- readr::read_rds("got.rds")
```

Just to remind ourselves of what we're working with, let's make sure we print out our vertex and edge attributes

```{r}
summary(g)
```

### 2b.) Discovering Properties

The first thing that we should do when considering any graph is go get the total list of binaries. The summary of this graph shows us that it has **107** nodes and **352** edges, but we can do a bit better than the summary for finding out other properties.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(gt)

ID = c("Order", "Size", "Connected", "Directed", "Acyclic", "Weighted", "Simple", "Has Loops", "Is Multigraph", "Bipartite", "Tree", "Forest")
  
Value = c(gorder(g), ecount(g), is_connected(g), is_directed(g), is_acyclic(g), is_weighted(g), is_simple(g), any_loop(g), any_multiple(g), is_bipartite(g), is_tree(g), is_forest(g))
  
table <- data.table(ID, Value)
table %>% gt() %>% fmt_tf(columns = Value, tf_style = "yes-no") # nice little formatting trick... clever girl...
```

In some ways it feels silly to do this, but this information is critical for many of the remaining tasks. For example, knowing that the network is connected means that we don't have to worry about measures which can't be measured on a fragmented network or have no reasonable interpretation. It also means that we don't have to subset the network to consider only the giant component. Just in case you need to find the subgraph consisting of only the largest component, it's pretty easy.

```{r}
g2 <- largest_component(g)
```

### 2.c.) Structural and Fragmentation

#### Bridges and Articulation Points

First things first, we should look to see if there are any bridges or articulation points in the data.

```{r}
cat("There are", length(bridges(g)), "bridges in this graph, and there are", 
    length(articulation_points(g)), "articulation points in this graph.")
```

Yikes. Let's find out what they are.

```{r}
bridges(g)
```

```{r}
articulation_points(g)
```

I can't deny that I have no idea who most of these characters are, but what this implies is that, if any of these bridges are cut (individuals stop connecting with each other) or any of the nodes are removed, the graph would be fractured into multiple components (each component would have more than one node). Based on this, some of our measures are going to be rather trivial in this network because these bridges and articulation points exist.

#### Diameter:

The diameter of a graph depends on a few parameters:

```         
diameter(graph, 
  directed = TRUE, 
  unconnected = TRUE,   
  weights = NULL)
```

Diameter makes the assumption that the graph is unconnected and adjusts for that by finding the diameter of the largest connected component. It also makes the assumption that the graph is directed and enforces this property. If a graph is directed and you change this property to false, it will treat it as an undirected graph and give you a useless answer. Similarly, providing a disconnected graph and changing the unconnected parameter to `FALSE` will give you a value of infinity (`Inf`). However, simply leaving these parameters as `TRUE` will give you a correct result regardless. Let's calculated the diameter of our graph.

```{r}
diameter(g)
```

**85** seems really high for the diameter of the graph. Doesn't that imply that the message would have to go through **85** people to get between the two farthest nodes on the graph! Let's find out who they are!

```{r}
farthest_vertices(g)
```

Well, that didn't help. I don't know who Illyrio and Salladhor are, so I couldn't tell you if this is even remotely reasonable. We can get the path, but you'd better be prepared for a long list.

```{r}
get_diameter(g)
```

Uh... Wait. That doesn't look like **85**. What happened here? Actually it's pretty easy. There's an edge property called weight. Even without telling igraph to use this parameter, it does so. Notice:

```{r}
diameter(g, weights = E(g)$weight)
```

This is one of the standard operations in igraph. For a weighted graph, you actually have to `OVERRIDE` this parameter by passing it `NA`.

```{r}
diameter(g, weights = NA)
```

So, in this case, the edge traversal would need **6** edges to get between the absolute farthest members of the network. Now, this is one of those conundrums where a higher weight actually indicates an easier transmission of information rather than harder. But wait, it gets weirder. There are multiple paths of length **6** (ignoring weights), so the diameter of the graph is unique, but the indicated path is _NOT_ unique and neither are the end points.

```{r}
get_diameter(g, weights = NA)
```

One warning here: **do not conflate "connection strength" with "flow efficiency"**. They are related, but not the same thing. Large pipes carry more water, but longer pipes will still take longer. If you want to measure flow efficiency, you need to have an edge attribute for that (i.e. if you want to find the "Most Efficient" route it may be very different from what the diameter gives us). If the weights on our graph represented travel time between two towns, then the diameter ("longest shortest path") WOULD measure the longest travel time between two towns in the network. However, with weights representing the strength of ties, it would take a little more thought. One common method is to change weights to distances by using the reciprocal.

```{r}
diameter(g, weights = 1/E(g)$weight)
```

```{r}
get_diameter(g, weights = 1/E(g)$weight)
```

And now we have a completely different answer for the longest of the shortest paths and who is involved in the process.

### Conductance:

Now we get to a more difficult problem. In fact, we get to an NP problem.

(Note: I am IGNORING the conductance for directed graphs. Some work from **2005** describes Laplacians and Cheeger inequalities on directed graphs (<https://fanchung.ucsd.edu/wp/cheeger.pdf>) and this is way harder to work with.)

Conductance was defined to be:

$$
\phi(G) = \min\limits_{S \subset V} \phi(S) = \min\limits_{S \subset V} \frac{vol(E(S))}{min\{vol(S), vol(\bar{S}\}} 
$$

```{r}
conductance_of_set <- function(g, S, weights = E(g)$weight) {
  if (is.null(weights)) weights <- rep(1, ecount(g))

  S <- as.integer(S)
  S_flag <- rep(FALSE, vcount(g))
  S_flag[S] <- TRUE

  ep <- ends(g, E(g), names = FALSE)
  crossing <- xor(S_flag[ep[,1]], S_flag[ep[,2]])
  cut_w <- sum(weights[crossing], na.rm = TRUE)

  # weighted degrees
  if (!is.null(E(g)$weight)) {
    deg_w <- strength(g, vids = V(g), mode = "all", weights = E(g)$weight)
  } else {
    deg_w <- degree(g)
  }

  vol_S  <- sum(deg_w[S])
  vol_cS <- sum(deg_w[!S_flag])

  denom <- min(vol_S, vol_cS)
  if (denom == 0) return(0)
  cut_w / denom
}
```

But, this generally requires that we perform this calculation on all possible cutsets which partition a graph and then find the minimum of this set of values. The increase to the numbers of cutsets available increases at a rate faster than polynomial which makes this problem **_NP_**. Generally, this calculation is restricted to "balanced" sets in order to ease the process (and reduce the number of required calculations), but even finding "balanced" sets in a weighted graph is a difficult problem.

To get around this, several attempts have been made to find efficient algorithms or bound the value. One of the most elegant that I have seen is presented in <https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2020/REUPapers/Zhang,Yueheng.pdf>

Theorem 3.2.7 provides Cheeger's inequality for a graph $G$ and concludes:

$$
\frac{\lambda_2}{2} \leq \phi(G) \leq \sqrt{2\lambda_2}
$$

where $\lambda_2$ is the second smallest eigenvalue to the normalized Laplacian. If you kept up in the lecture notes, this is the same $\lambda_2$ that we identified as Algebraic Connectivity (i.e. Fiedler's value). EXCEPT Fiedler's value is calculated on the entire graph but conductance is only defined on a connected graph (i.e. the "giant component"). So, this means that if we can restrict the graph to the largest component we can find bounds on the estimate for conductance for the largest connected component of the graph by using the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian on this component.

```{r}

L <- laplacian_matrix(g, weights = E(g)$weight, normalization = "symmetric")
ev <- eigen(L, symmetric = TRUE, only.values = TRUE)$values
lambda_2 <- ev[length(ev) - 1]

```

```{r}
cat("The conductance is bounded by", lambda_2/2, "and", sqrt(2*lambda_2), ".")
```

Okay, so now that we have upper bounds, it turns out there is a special vector $v_2$ associated with the eigenvalue $\lambda_2$. This is the associated eigenvector. Using this, we can find the associated Fiedler values for every vertex and order these from smallest to largest. By successively adding into the set of vertices and computing conductance for every one of them, we can find the set with minimum conductance.

Since we have this method to get a potential set to work with, we can implement these sweeps.

```{r}
fiedler_sweep_cut <- function(g) {

  # Make sure it's undirected and weighted sensibly
  if (is_directed(g)) {
    g <- as_undirected(g, mode="collapse", edge.attr.comb = list(weight="sum"))
  }

  # Compute symmetric normalized Laplacian
  L <- laplacian_matrix(g, weights = E(g)$weight, normalization = "symmetric")

  # Eigen-decomposition: eigenvalues in *descending order*
  ev <- eigen(L, symmetric = TRUE)

  # Fiedler vector = eigenvector for second-smallest eigenvalue
  fiedler_vec <- ev$vectors[, ncol(ev$vectors) - 1]

  # Sweep: sort vertices by Fiedler values
  ord <- order(fiedler_vec)

  best_phi <- Inf
  best_S <- NULL

  for (t in 1:(length(ord) - 1)) {
    S <- ord[1:t]
    phi_S <- conductance_of_set(g, S)
    if (phi_S < best_phi) {
      best_phi <- phi_S
      best_S <- S
    }
  }

  list(
    phi = best_phi,
    S = best_S,
    fiedler_vector = fiedler_vec
  )
}

```

```{r}
res <- fiedler_sweep_cut(g)
cat("Best φ from spectral sweep:", res$phi, "\n")

```

This is probably NOT the true value of conductance but has been shown to be very close which is an encouraging thing on an NP-hard problem.

An alternative to this method is the Andersen-Chung-Lang (ACL) Local Graph Partitioning method.

<https://fanchung.ucsd.edu/wp/localpartition.pdf>

Since `page_rank()` is well defined in `igraph`, we can actually implement this very easily, but because this is geared towards local calculations, it is very likely to find a much higher value than the true global value. It's more of a sanity check than a real calculation of conductance.

```{r}
page_rank_sweep_cut <- function(g, alpha = 0.15) {

  if (is.directed(g)) {
    g <- as.undirected(g, mode="collapse", edge.attr.comb=list(weight="sum"))
  }

  # Weighted PageRank
  pr <- page_rank(g, algo = "prpack", damping = 1 - alpha,
                  weights = E(g)$weight)$vector

  # Normalize by weighted degree (this matters!)
  deg <- strength(g, vids = V(g), mode = "all", weights = E(g)$weight)
  score <- pr / deg

  ord <- order(score, decreasing = TRUE)  # highest score first

  best_phi <- Inf
  best_S <- NULL

  for (t in 1:(length(ord)-1)) {
    S <- ord[1:t]
    phi <- conductance_of_set(g, S)
    if (phi < best_phi) {
      best_phi <- phi
      best_S <- S
    }
  }

  list(
    phi = best_phi,
    vertex_ids = best_S,
    vertex_names = V(g)$name[best_S],
    page_rank = pr,
    score = score
  )
}

```

Employing this algorithm:

```{r}
conductance_2 <- page_rank_sweep_cut(g)
```

And our results are:

```{r}
conductance_2$phi
```

Again, this is MUCH higher but within the Cheeger bound indicating that local conductance tends to be relatively high compared to global conductance. With a value very close to zero, partitioning this graph is likely very easy and strong bottlenecks exist.

#### Adhesion

Once again, Adhesion only works on fully connected graphs, so we would need to use the largest connected component if we didn't have a connected graph. Luckily, we have a direct function for this one:

```{r}
adhesion((g))
```

Granted, we already knew this because there are bridges in our graph. There are also articulation points so...

#### Node Connectivity

```{r}
vertex_connectivity(g)
```

#### Fiedler's Value $\lambda_2$ (Algebraic Connectivity)

Yeah, I showed this one above already:

```{r}
L <- laplacian_matrix(g, weights = E(g)$weight, normalization = "symmetric")
ev <- eigen(L, symmetric = TRUE, only.values = TRUE)$values
lambda_2 <- ev[length(ev) - 1]
```

```{r}
lambda_2
```

So, just so we're all on the same page here, the bounds on Fiedler's value is actually $[0, 2]$, _NOT_ $[0, 1]$ like we would expect. This comes from the fact that we use the symmetric normalized Laplacian rather than the random walk version. If we were looking at random walk mixing or diffusion properties (i.e. Markov Chain properties rather than shortest path style methods) we would want to use the other version of the matrix method provided in the notes by changing the normalization method in the Laplacian-matrix calculation and adapting the eigenvalue method by changing symmetric to false.

In terms of interpretation, there's not much "glue" to this network. It's easily fracturable and at high risk of splintering based on the connections we have observed.

### 2.d.) Interconnectedness

#### Edge Density

```{r}
edge_density(g, loops = FALSE)
```

You have to be pretty careful about the loops part of this calculation, because if you are wrong, the results don't make sense. Remember, this measure isn't very useful except for comparison, so I'm not going to spend much time here.

#### Network Cohesion

```{r}
cohesion(g)
```

Remember how our graph is connected and has bridges? Our cohesion is 1. BUT the version of cohesion presented in `igraph` is ACTUALLY the graph theory definition of cohesion, not the social network theory version of cohesion! In graph theory, cohesion is:

$$
\text{cohesion}(G) = \min\limits_{u \neq v} \lambda(u,v)
$$

Where $\lambda(u,v)$ is the number of pairwise local edges between $u$ and $v$ for a given graph.

In social networks, we defined cohesion to be the "reachability ratio." I.e. the proportion of nodes where a path exists between them. This ratio depends on whether or not the graph is directed or not:

```{r}
#Note that we are specifying directed reachability for directed graphs
reachability_cohesion <- function(g, mode = c("undirected", "weak", "strong")) {
  mode <- match.arg(mode)
  n <- vcount(g)
  if (n <= 1) return(1)

  if (mode == "undirected") {
    g2 <- as_undirected(g, mode = "collapse",
                        edge.attr.comb = list(weight = "sum"))
    D <- distances(g2)
    reachable <- sum(D != Inf) - n      # exclude self-pairs
    total <- n * (n - 1)

  } else if (mode == "weak") {
    # treat as undirected for reachability
    comps <- components(g, mode = "weak")$membership
    comp_sizes <- table(comps)
    reachable <- sum(comp_sizes * (comp_sizes - 1))
    total <- n * (n - 1)

  } else if (mode == "strong") {
    D <- distances(g, mode = "out")
    reachable <- sum(D != Inf) - n
    total <- n * (n - 1)
  }

  cohesion <- reachable / total
  return(cohesion)
}
```

```{r}
reachability_cohesion(g)
```

It's still **1** in our case because the graph is connected, but this is the measure we discussed in class: The Reachability Ratio.

#### Global Clustering Coefficient (Transitivity)

In class, I mentioned that there are several methods of calculating transitivity for weighted graphs. `igraph` implements "Barrat" as the appropriate method; however, remember that this does not work if you have a multigraph or loops. You MUST `simplify()` the graph first in those cases. On the plus side, global transitivity is easy to calculate. On the downside, weighted methods are only implemented for local transitivity.

```{r}
transitivity(g, type = "globalundirected", isolates = "NaN")
```

Now we have a choice. There are multiple "correct" ways of getting a global measure for a weighted graph, but the most common is to use the arithmetic mean of local transitiveness. This isn't all that hard, but requires that we write another function.

```{r}
global_weighted_transitivity <- function(g, mode = c("undirected", "directed")) {
  mode <- match.arg(mode)

  if (mode == "undirected") {
    # This does nothing if the graph is already undirected but collapses a directed graph
    g2 <- as_undirected(g, mode = "collapse",
                        edge.attr.comb = list(weight = "sum"))
    local <- transitivity(g2, type = "weighted")
  } else {
    # Directed -> use directed weights but still based on Barrat formulation
    local <- transitivity(g, type = "weighted")
  }

  # Remove NA values (degree < 2)
  local <- local[!is.na(local)]

  # Average global weighted clustering
  mean(local)
}
```

```{r}
global_weighted_transitivity(g, mode = "undirected")
```

I'm going to pause here because these two measures actually tell us two different things. The unweighted transitivity is based on the proportion of triangles that exist when compared to the total that could exist. The weighted version actually tells us the strength of the embedding for the node based on intensity. The average of this being much higher tells us that there are some clusters with very strong ties. I.e. it answers the question of how strongly do triads reinforce each other? It is common to look at a distribution of these weighted triads to understand whether this comes from a lot of moderately strong connections or from a few VERY strong connections.

#### Assortativity

We talked about degree assortativity in class, so let's implement that first.

```{r}
assortativity_degree(g)
```

That's it. Essentially, because this value is negative, it indicates that individuals with high degree don't necessarily aggregate together (except that this measure doesn't account for the fact that the weights on our edges indicate the number of associations between individuals, so this measure DOES NOT WORK because this graph would naturally be a multigraph.

This is critical. Do NOT just apply functions without thinking. Remember the measure we talked about called strength?

```{r}
strengths <- strength(g, mode = "all", weights = E(g)$weight)
```

This gives us a value to calculate correlations over other than degree.

```{r}
assortativity(g, strengths, directed = FALSE)
```

This is the correct value. It didn't change a lot, but it answers the question, do people with strong ties tend to associate with other people that have strong ties. And the answer is, no, they don't tend to do so within this network.

### 2.e.) Centralization

#### Degree Centralization

```{r}
centr_degree(g, mode = "all")$centralization
```

Remember how we said that degree is a useless measure in our graph (because it is an explicit multigraph) and strength matters more? And we have already calculated strengths. In cases like this, there is a general centralization function available.

```{r}
centralize(strengths, theoretical.max = sum(strengths)*(length(strengths) - 1), normalized = TRUE)
```

#### Closeness Centralization

```{r}
centr_clo(g, mode = "all")$centralization
```

Or at least this would be the answer if all edges have the same weight, but really this can't be the case when our edge weights represent strength of association based on number of interactions The real "distance" here isn't measured by the edge weights because that would indicate that higher values are further apart (cost more to travel). On a typical weighted graph, this would be right, but on ours, the reciprocal is true, and that's exactly how we can redefine our distances:

$$
d_{ij} = 1/w_{ij}
$$

```{r}
centr_clo_weighted <- function(g) {
  # convert tie strength → distance
  d <- 1 / E(g)$weight
  
  # weighted closeness
  C <- closeness(g, weights = d)
  
  # remove Inf or NA (isolates)
  C <- C[is.finite(C)]
  
  C_max <- max(C)
  num <- sum(C_max - C)
  #Set a theoretical maximum based on the total distance represented in the network
  denom <- (length(C) - 1) * C_max 
  
  if (denom == 0) return(0)
  num / denom
}
```

```{r}
centr_clo_weighted(g)
```

#### Betweenness Centralization

```{r}
centr_betw(g)$centralization
```

Betweenness demonstrates choke points and imbalance of brokerage power on shortest paths. This means that the weights matter, and once again, costs needs to be measured based on the strength of association (or reciprocal weights) yet again. I'm not just making this up either. <https://toreopsahl.com/tnet/weighted-networks/node-centrality/>

```{r}
centr_betw_weighted <- function(g) {
  # Convert strength → distance
  d <- 1 / E(g)$weight
  
  # weighted betweenness
  b <- betweenness(g, directed = FALSE, weights = d)
  
  b_max <- max(b)
  num <- sum(b_max - b)
  denom <- (length(b) - 1) * b_max
  
  if (denom == 0) return(0)
  num / denom
}

```

#### Eigenvector Centralization

```{r}
centr_eigen(g)$centralization
```

Yay, this means... nothing because once again, our weight measures are actually implicitly defining a multigraph where the degree measure is misleading! We need to create our same functionality again:

```{r}
centr_eigen_weighted <- function(g) {
  # weighted EC scores
  ec <- eigen_centrality(g, weights = E(g)$weight)$vector
  
  # remove missing values (rare but can occur)
  ec <- ec[is.finite(ec)]
  
  ec_max <- max(ec)
  
  # Freeman numerator
  num <- sum(ec_max - ec)
  
  # theoretical maximum for normalized star
  # (one node gets ec_max, all others get 0)
  denom <- (length(ec) - 1) * ec_max
  
  if (denom == 0) return(0)
  
  num / denom
}
```

```{r}
centr_eigen_weighted(g)
```

Perfect, this is actually a meaningful measure for eigenvector centrality. Do you remember what this meant?

### 2.f.) Efficiency

So, once again, the weights on the edges being strengths rather than distances means that efficiency should be calculated based on the reciprocal values. Let's just store those as an edge attribute.

```{r}
E(g)$dist = 1/E(g)$weight
```

#### Global Efficiency

```{r}
global_efficiency(g, weights = E(g)$dist)
```

#### Average Local Efficiency

```{r}
average_local_efficiency(g, weights = E(g)$dist, mode = "all")
```

#### Average Shortest Path Length

```{r}
mean_distance(g, weights = E(g)$dist)
```

So we have very strongly tied local networks when compared to the overall global structure. This seems perfectly normal, and the average shortest path length is going to be pretty small based on how strong some of the ties are. (now look back at diameter. Is something wrong?)

I purposefully chose a difficult dataset where the weights have a common (but annoying) underlying interpretation. If you don't understand the nuance of the measures, it is common to perform these calculations incorrectly and get results that are outright meaningless if not the opposite of what you are truly looking for!

## 3.) Summary:

Strength-based weights: weights encode tie strength → larger = closer / faster / more interaction

Distance-based weights (opposite case): weights encode cost → larger = farther / harder / more expensive

Distance metric: For strength-based weights →

$$\text{distance} = \frac{1}{\text{weight}}$$

I have to admit, that is a nicely made table. Well done!

### Dataset description:

#### Description:

_Project Caviar_ was a unique investigation that targeted a network of hashish and cocaine importers operating out of Montreal. The      network was targeted between **1994** and **1996** by a tandem investigation uniting the Montreal Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other national and regional law-enforcement agencies from various countries (i.e. England, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Paraguay, and Colombia). The case is unique because it involved a specific investigative approach that will be referred to as a “seize and wait” strategy. Unlike most law-enforcement strategies, the mandate set forward in the _Project Caviar_ case was to seize identified drug consignments, but not to arrest any of the identified participants. This took place over a **2**-year period. Thus, although **11** importation consignments were seized at different moments throughout this period, arrests only took place at the end of the investigation. What this case offers is a rare opportunity to study the evolution of a criminal network phenomenon as it was being disrupted by law-enforcement agents. The inherent investigative strategy permits an assessment of change in the network structure and an inside look into how network participants react and adapt to the growing constraints set upon them. The principal data source was comprised of information submitted as evidence during the trials of **22** participants in the Caviar network. It included **4,279** paragraphs of information (over **1,000** pages) revealing electronically intercepted telephone conversations between network participants. These transcripts were used to create the overall matrix of the drug-trafficking operation’s communication system throughout the course of the investigation. Individuals falling in the surveillance net were not all participants in the trafficking operation. An initial extraction of all names appearing in the surveillance data led to the identification of **318** individuals. From this pool, **208** individuals were not implicated in the trafficking operations. Most were simply named during the many transcripts of conversations, but never detected. Others who were detected had no clear participatory role within the network (e.g., family members or legitimate entrepreneurs). The final network was thus composed of **110** participants. 

#### Network

**11**x **1**-mode matrices person by person, representing the **11** phases of the investigation. **_Ties_** are _directed_ **and** _valued_. Number of nodes:
1) **15**x**15**
2) **24**x**24**
3) **33**x**33**
4) **33**x**33**
5) **32**x**32**
6) **27**x**27**
7) **34**x**34**
8) **42**x**42**
9) **34**x**34**
10) **42**x**42**
11) **41**x**41**

**1**-mode matrix **110** x **110** person by person of the complete network. **_Ties_** are communication exchanges between criminals. **_Values_** represent level of communication activity. Data comes from police wiretapping.

I have provided a `graphml` object containing the **110** person network for you to analyze the general topology of. Using the work above as an example, calculate the measures associated with this graph.
